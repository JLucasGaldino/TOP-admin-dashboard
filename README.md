# TOP-admin-dashboard
In this project, I am using CSS grid and flex in order to create a simple mockup dashboard layout. I am also putting into practice the principles of BEM (block, element, modifier) in the naming conventions.

# Notes for myself, on future projects
- Always start with a non-code design, to help your planning.
- Set each element's paddings and areas beforehand, and you can change them later.
- Bem methodology cannot be fully applied in a single-page design.
- Don't be overzealous naming BEM components from the start, because you may need to make changes.
- Make your themes more coherent by planning it beforehand.
